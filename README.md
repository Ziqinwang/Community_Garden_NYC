## Data Visulization

Most of the original dataset were taken from [New York Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) and [OASIS](http://www.oasisnyc.net/pages/data.aspx/). I converted the raw data into useful shapefile and Geojson for the analysis part with my capstone [click to download](https://github.com/Ziqinwang/Community_Garden_NYC/blob/master/capstone_ziqin.pdf) and did the interacitve web mapping part for my JavaScript final project.
